# TextHelper

An Android App which can help you in case you have lost your phone and you know you can find it just by ringing but the phone is in silent mode.
So, if this app is installed in your device and it is allowed to running in the background, I need to just a simple text a meassgae from other mobile in some specific pattern, and your phone will be in normal ring mode with full volume.

Other than this, if you forget your mobile at home and you are outside home or you don't have a particular mobile in which contact is saved that you want at that moment when you are outside. So now you have to just text a simple meassage in specific pattern and contact will be sent automatically to you.
Again the condition it is this app must be installed in your that mobile in which the contact is saved and the app is allowed to run in background and all the permissiona are granted.

New Features will be added as soon as possible.

So Install this app app and Enjoy the Services.
